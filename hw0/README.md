This project is a simple C program that runs the alebian sandpile simulation in a command prompt. It runs a breadth-first-search-type recursive approach, by incrementing each neighbor of a cell that hits 8, and toppling any of those neighbors if they hit 8, and so on. 

To generate the compiled file, please run `make compile`. Next, to run the compiled code, run `make run`. To delete the compiled file, run `make clean`.
