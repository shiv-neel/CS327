This project is a simple C program that runs the alebian sandpile simulation in a command prompt. It runs a breadth-first-search-type recursive approach, by incrementing each neighbor of a cell that hits 8, and toppling any of those neighbors if they hit 8, and so on. 

To generate the compiled file, run `make`, and then run `./sandpile` followed by the desired array of inputs.

**NOTE**: I completed this project before the need for a changelog was discussed, so I don't have a proper changelog for this project. I will be sure to have one in future projects.
